# Onboarding

This is the starting page for new team members.

You need these accounts:
1. A member access to [HSL Slack](https://hsldevcom.slack.com).
  - Ask the Product Owner (PO).
  - Use your preferred email address.
  - Needed for discussions across the HSL organization. Jore4 relates to many projects.
1. An external ("EXT") HSL Microsoft account.
  - Ask the PO.
  - Needed for Azure, Sharepoint and possibly other services where `@hsl.fi` email address gets a preference.
1. HSL ID account
  - Create it yourself: <https://www.hsl.fi/user/auth/login?language=fi>
  - There are also test versions for HSL ID. 
  - Use your preferred email address unless told otherwise.
  - Ask the PO to add your email address into Jore3 so that you can sign into Jore Map UI.
